## Student Learning Outcomes

- Gain a basic understanding of programming and electronics fundamentals
- Effectively use prototyping as a methodology for project development
- Draft a realistic project development plan
- Use listening skills and improvisation to support collaborative efforts
- Continue self-learning of new programming languages and techniques

## Course Organization/Method of Instruction

The goal of this course is to create an interactive work _together_. To achieve this, we&#39;ll adopt a philosophy to _embrace unpredictability in the medium and with each other_.

Each class will start with a warm-up activity that will aim to help us internalize:

- Listening as a form of collaboration
- Improvisation as collaboration

Technical skills and programming will be approached as a creative process with a focus on prototyping as a methodology for project development. The rapid development of projects in-class is meant to encourage the prototype approach to project development.

So, in addition to our warm-up activity, the class will continue with either a lecture, usually programming focused, or workshop where the class breaks into smaller groups to create a work based on a given prompt. These group projects should use the skills that we just learned in class and also introduce your own artistic practice to the collaboration.

For students in different time-zones:

- Workshop days will be noted in advance. Given the collaborative nature of this class, you are encouraged to attend the workshop days
- All classes will be recorded and archived for asynchronous attendance
- When you cannot attend, please follow up on discord or by email. We will work something out!

## Course Requirements

Active participation is fundamental to this course. Even if programming is not your main interest, you can still participate by applying their artistic practice to the collaborative aspects of this class, participating in project discussions, etc.

### Assignments

Assignments will be in-class group projects. It is up to you if you prefer to complete additional work on your projects outside of class. Readings should be completed before class.

### Technology Requirements

- Personal computer with USB port (an iPad will not work for this course)
- Adapter for USB-A to USB-C if your computer only has USB-C ports
- Zoom for class lectures and collaborations (camera optional)

## Grading/Evaluation

| Activity                  | Weight |
| :------------------------ | :----- |
| Attendance, Participation | 40%    |
| Weekly Activities         | 40%    |
| Final Project             | 20%    |

**Evaluation Criteria:** Assignments are evaluated on level of effort and participation. This does not mean the work has to be complex, but just that you tried. For instance, programming assignments should demonstrate effort even if they are not totally functional (i.e. a copy-pasted tutorial is not acceptable, however a modified tutorial to support an artistic concept is). Group assignments are evaluated on members&#39; level of participation.

## Course Policies &amp; Expectations

### Class Engagement Policy

**Be Active:** Participate! This is an active community of learners; passively completing the course materials is not enough to ensure success in this course. Participating in the Discord discussions will also help you stay up-to-date and engaged.

### In-Class Behavior

**Be Responsible:** My goal is for you to succeed in this class and to be able to apply what you learn to your chosen path. However, you are responsible for doing well. You are expected to read all reading materials and to participate in group and class activities. You are also expected to ask questions and or/schedule individual appointments with me or the TA if you have any questions.

**Be Kind: Be courteous and respectful** to your classmates and your instructor(s) through considerate **etiquette**. In this course, that includes (but is not limited to):

1. Maintain a formal, respectful, civil, professional tone with all course communications to all course participants, including but not limited to journals, discussion boards, and emails.
2. Avoid derogatory language, obscenity, and hate speech.
3. Avoid the use of CAPS in writing, as this indicates shouting.

### Class Climate &amp; Inclusivity

#### Forms of Address: Names and Pronouns

CalArts recognizes the importance of a diverse student body, and we are committed to fostering equitable classroom environments. You are invited, if you wish, to tell us how you want to be referred to both in terms of your name and your pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.). The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity.

Additionally, how you identify in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity, is your choice whether to disclose (e.g. should it come up in classroom conversation about experiences and perspectives) and should be self-identified, not presumed or imposed.

#### Point of View

The readings, class lecture, and my comments in class will suggest a particular point of view. This perspective is my own and **does not have to be yours**. I encourage you to respectfully disagree with the ideas in the readings and lectures as well as the perspectives of your colleagues in the course. **Please express yourself**. A significant part of an education is learning about the complexity of various issues. Therefore, it is important that we listen and respect one another but we do not have to agree. A richer discussion will occur when a variety of perspectives are presented in class for discussion.

#### Discussion Guidelines

In order to learn, we must be open to the views of people different from ourselves. In this time we share together over the semester, please honor the uniqueness of your fellow classmates and appreciate the opportunity we have to learn from one another. Please respect each others&#39; opinions and refrain from personal attacks or demeaning comments of any kind. Finally, remember to keep confidential all issues of a personal or professional nature that are discussed in class.

### Missing Class Due to COVID-19

Students who are ill, under quarantine for COVID-19, or suspect they are ill will report that to Maria-Victoria Perez, Director, Care and Well-being (m-vperez@calarts.edu) . The director will verify and notify all faculty who have that student. Once notification is made, all faculty will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the student&#39;s absence and will communicate that accommodation directly to the student.
